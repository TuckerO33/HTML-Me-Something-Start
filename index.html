               I had picked up a job changing oil in December of 2019, seeking a temporary lil' something while I got back on my feet after
               being forced out of Hong Kong due to visa issues and increasing civil unrest.

               That lil' something got extended to over a year, as COVID hit and I hunkered down into my 'essential worker' role.

               I had a piece of shit apartment in Maplewood. Nice enough area, little shooty, but where isn't am I right?
               (I shouldn't be right)
               ((but with the kind of money I was making, shooty was a necessary neighborhood element))

               What made it piece-of-shit-y was the bug infestation and crumbling, leaking ceiling that my landlord chronically 
               failed to fix.

               Committed to choosing homelessness before moving back in with my parents, I pitched a tent on top of my bed so I could
               sleep without getting bit up by the bugs. 

               Fortunatley, my friend offered to let me stay at his place.
               Unfortunately, the place was actually his mother's, who was already sheltering two other guys unemployed from COVID
               shutdowns. Seeing that it was still a step up, I took the offer and moved in.

               Saving up money from not paying rent, I built up enough to be able to comfortably quit my job and sought to 
               spend a month writing in a cabin somewhere.

               The (adequately remote) cabins in the US were prohibitively expensive, so I picked a place to rent in Jaumave, Tamaulipas, Mexico.
               Armed with atrophied Spanish skills from high school, I spent a week driving down there, stopping to stay with friends along the way.
               First stop was Wichita, KS, staying with my friend Teresa, an Ayurvedic doctor and therapist.

               Next stop was Waco, TX staying with my high school buddy Ryan, a filmmaker (he wrote this award winning short film : *insert URL*)
               After that I stayed in an Air Bnb in Harlingen, at the Southern tip of Texas.
               Finally, I drove into Mexico, all the way to Jaumave.

               Driving past the town, I headed to the cabin, pulling off the highway onto an unmarked dirt road. I guessed on which turns to make,
               passing little ranches, until I arrived at a cluster of buildings. I got out to ask for directions, and it turned out I was at the Spa.
               I was confused. One of the workers, Fer, guided me to where I would be staying.

               The pictures on Air BnB led me to believe I would be way out on my own, but I was apart of a cluster of three cabins, all owned by the same resort!
               I parked and got settled, a little frustrated that my expectations were not met.

               I stayed in that cabin for over a month, writing on the Royal Quiet Deluxe typewriter my grandmother gave to me before I left St. Louis.
               I made bonfires, went hiking, exploring. 
               
               Rode a horse that very clearly did not want to be ridden, however they had gone through so much trouble
               to get the horse ready for me, I did not want to be rude and decline to ride it.

               I also realized that my desire for isolation not being met was actually a blessing, and made friends along the way. 
               The people there were very hospitable and patient with my limited Spanish skills.

               I had heard about a national park nearby, a nature preserve called El Cielo. I invited some of my friends to come with me for a tour. We pooled our money together 
               and rented a 4x4 truck tour, driving us up into the mountains.

               I was excited for a shared, quiet commune with rare natural beauty. What I didn't realize, was that my young friends wanted to get violently drunk and blast music the whole time.
               This conflict of expectations led to tension that I did not have the language skills to resolve. Still had a good time though!
