               I had picked up a job changing oil in December of 2019,<br> 
               seeking a temporary lil' something while I got back on my feet after<br>
               being forced out of Hong Kong due to visa issues and increasing civil unrest.<br>
               <br>
               That lil' something got extended to over a year, as COVID hit and I hunkered down into my 'essential worker' role.<br>

               Saving up some money, I built up enough to be able to comfortably quit my job and sought to<br>
               spend a month writing in a cabin somewhere.<br>

               The (adequately remote) cabins in the US were prohibitively expensive, so I picked a place to rent in Jaumave, Tamaulipas, Mexico.<br>
               Armed with atrophied Spanish skills from high school, I spent a week driving down there, stopping to stay with friends along the way.<br>
               Next stop was Waco, TX staying with my high school buddy Ryan, a filmmaker<br>
               (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJvR1ChdV6o">he wrote this award winning short film</a>)<br>
               After that I stayed in an Air Bnb in Harlingen, at the Southern tip of Texas.<br>
               Finally, I drove into Mexico, all the way to Jaumave.

               Driving past the town, I headed to the cabin, pulling off the highway onto an unmarked dirt road.<br>
               I guessed on which turns to make,<br>
               passing little ranches, until I arrived at a cluster of buildings. I got out to ask for directions, and it turned out I was at the Spa.<br>
               I was confused. One of the workers, Fer, guided me to where I would be staying.

               The pictures on Air BnB led me to believe I would be way out on my own, but I was apart of a cluster of three cabins, all owned by the same resort!<br>
               I parked and got settled, a little frustrated that my expectations were not met.<br>

               I stayed in that cabin for over a month, writing on the Royal Quiet Deluxe typewriter my grandmother gave to me before I left St. Louis.<br>

               Some of the people I showed it to were shocked that it did not have a key for N&#771; (because English does not use that letter!)<br>
               I made bonfires, went hiking, exploring.<br>
               <br>
               Rode a horse that very clearly did not want to be ridden, however they had gone through so much trouble<br>
               to get the horse ready for me, I did not want to be rude and decline to ride it.<br>
               <br>
               I also realized that my desire for isolation not being met was actually a blessing, and made friends along the way.<br> 
               The people there were very hospitable and patient with my limited Spanish skills.<br>
               <br>

               I had heard about a national park nearby, a nature preserve called El Cielo.<br>
               I invited some of my friends to come with me for a tour.<br> 
               We pooled our money together and rented a 4x4 truck tour, driving us up into the mountains.<br>

               I was excited for a shared, quiet commune with rare natural beauty. What I didn't realize, was that my young friends wanted to get violently drunk and blast music the whole time.<br>
               This conflict of expectations led to tension that I did not have the language skills to resolve. Still had a good time though!<br>
